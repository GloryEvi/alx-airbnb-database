## Performance Testing Queries

### Before Index Creation
```sql
-- Test Query 1: Property search by location and price
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM Property 
WHERE location = 'New York' AND price_per_night BETWEEN 100 AND 200;

-- Test Query 2: User booking history
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, COUNT(b.booking_id) as booking_count
FROM User u
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'guest'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name;

-- Test Query 3: Property availability check
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.name, p.location
FROM Property p
WHERE p.property_id NOT IN (
    SELECT b.property_id
    FROM Booking b
    WHERE b.start_date <= '2024-07-15' 
    AND b.end_date >= '2024-07-10'
    AND b.status = 'confirmed'
);

-- Test Query 4: Property ratings analysis
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.name, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating, COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
HAVING AVG(r.rating) > 4.0;
```

### After Index Creation
Run the same queries and compare results.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Query 1: Property Search
- **Before**: Full table scan on Property table
- **After**: Index seek on `idx_property_location_price` composite index
- **Expected Improvement**: 80-90% reduction in execution time

### Query 2: User Booking History
- **Before**: Full table scan on User table + nested loop join
- **After**: Index seek on `idx_user_role` + index seek on `idx_booking_user_id`
- **Expected Improvement**: 70-85% reduction in execution time

### Query 3: Property Availability
- **Before**: Full table scan on Booking table for date comparisons
- **After**: Index range scan on `idx_booking_property_dates`
- **Expected Improvement**: 85-95% reduction in execution time

### Query 4: Property Ratings
- **Before**: Full table scan on Review table
- **After**: Index seek on `idx_review_property_rating`
- **Expected Improvement**: 75-90% reduction in execution time

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

### Execution Time
- Measure query execution time before and after indexing
- Target: >70% reduction for indexed queries

### I/O Operations
- Monitor logical and physical reads
- Target: Significant reduction in page reads

### CPU Usage
- Monitor CPU time for query execution
- Target: Lower CPU utilization per query

### Scan vs Seek Operations
- **Before**: Table scans and index scans
- **After**: Index seeks and key lookups

## Index Maintenance Considerations

### Storage Overhead
- Indexes require additional storage space (typically 10-30% of table size)
- Monitor disk space usage after index creation

### Insert/Update/Delete Performance
- Indexes may slow down DML operations
- Monitor transaction performance for data modifications

### Index Fragmentation
- Schedule regular index maintenance
- Use `REBUILD` or `REORGANIZE` operations as needed

## Testing Methodology

1. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Run queries without indexes
   - Record execution time, I/O stats, CPU usage

2. **Index Creation**
   - Create indexes as specified in database_index.sql
   - Update table statistics

3. **Post-Index Measurement**
   - Run same queries with indexes
   - Record performance metrics

4. **Comparison Analysis**
   - Calculate percentage improvements
   - Document any unexpected results

## Sample EXPLAIN Output Analysis

### Before Index (Table Scan)
```
Seq Scan on property (cost=0.00..25.00 rows=1000 width=64)
Filter: ((location = 'New York') AND (price_per_night >= 100) AND (price_per_night <= 200))
```

### After Index (Index Seek)
```
Index Scan using idx_property_location_price on property (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=50 width=64)
Index Cond: ((location = 'New York') AND (price_per_night >= 100) AND (price_per_night <= 200))
```

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Query Performance**: Regularly analyze slow queries using database monitoring tools
2. **Index Selectivity**: Ensure indexes have good selectivity (low cardinality columns may not benefit)
3. **Composite Index Order**: Order columns in composite indexes based on query patterns (most selective first)
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule index maintenance during low-traffic periods
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes and query patterns
